							<h2>Profile</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="yui-u">
							<p class="enlarge">
								Seasoned technology professional, public speaker and expert iOS developer, with a track record of success in most areas of software product development and delivery.

							<h2>Skills</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="yui-u">

								<div class="talent">
									<h2>Software Development</h2>
									<p>I am an expert-level iOS (iPhone, iPad, AppleTV) software developer and have published over 10 applications to the Apple App Store. I am additionally fluent in creating web applications with Python/Django and Node.js.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="talent">
									<h2>Systems Design</h2>
									<p>I design and code highly-available systems/web applications with Python, Erlang, Node.js. I do this by separating the logical functionality of a system by process separation and tuning of software stacks after aggressive profiling of the minimum viable product, not by creating giant monolithic, multi-threaded monsters. </p>
								</div>

								<div class="talent">
									<h2>Startup Leadership</h2>
									<p>Building engineering teams, developing Minimum Viable Products (MVP) with little to no supervision and fundraising/bootstrapping. I am comfortable at all layers of the startup people stack, from individual contributor (software, product management) to CxO. I have participated in multi-million dollar funding rounds as a founder/co-founder and I know what it takes to get a company from $0 and no product to shipping software and making payroll.</p>
